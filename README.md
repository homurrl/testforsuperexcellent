The workday scheduler is a simple tool that allows you to save your work schedule to local storage, separate out time blocks into a standard work day, and display the current date and time.

To save your work schedule, simply select your desired time block and enter the required information. The scheduler will then create a new data file for each entry.


The date and time is current and shown at the top of the page.
